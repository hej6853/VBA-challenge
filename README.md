# VBA-challenge - The VBA of Wall Street
In this project I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

## Process Background

* Created a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

  * Return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 
  
  * Made the appropriate adjustments to my VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet. 

### Files
